[Course Sakai Website](http://sakai.duke.edu) <br>
The Sakai site allows you to check your grade on individual assignments and exams. 

[Course Piazza Site](https://piazza.com/duke/fall2016/math122l/home)  <br>
The Piazza site will be used by all students and instructors in Math 122L this semester. Whenever you have a question pertaining to course material, please post it on Piazza rather than emailing me. This way, all students can benefit from questions and answers. Additionally, I encourage you to try and answer your peer?s ques- tions. This can be done by a collective students response, and instructors will have the ability to add to such responses. 

[Help room schedule](http://math.duke.edu/help-room) <br>
The help room, which is located in room 132 of the Carr Building on East Campus, is an invaluable tool for math students. Beginning on Sunday, September 4th, the help room will be open from 1-10 PM Monday through Thursday, and from 6-10 PM on Sunday. The help room contains a copy of the solution manual and is run by calculus teachers and teaching assistants ready to answer your questions. This is also a good place to work on problems with other students. <br>
