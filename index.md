### Course Description and Objectives

Calculus studies two ideas, the effects of the way things change and the idea of the mathematical infinite. In your previous calculus course Math 105L, you have encountered these ideas in finding the derivative of a function. This course will continue in a slightly different setting, which is integral and differential equations. Topics include zeros of functions, antidifferentiation, initial value problems, differential equations, Euler's method, slope fields, review of trigonometry, modeling with trigonometric functions, Riemann sums, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, integration by substitution, integration by parts, separation of variables, systems of differential equations.

We will focus on problem solving skills and coherent writing as in Math 105L.

### Grading :
Your semester grade for this course will be determined by me based off my assessment of your overall performance in the course. Scores from the block final exam will be used in order to guage the performance of this section as a whole in comparison to other sections. This block grading system helps to ensure consistency of the meaning of letter grades across all sections of Math 106L. As a result of this policy, any letter grade assigned to assessments prior to the final exam should be considered an estimate. Your final grade in this course will be roughly comprised of the following: <br>

Homework and Labs 30% <br>
Midterms 40% <br>
Final Exam 30% <br>

To see a detailed description of grading in lab calculus courses, please reference the document titled [Block Calculus Course Policies](https://services.math.duke.edu/~jma/m212f2015/BlockCalculusCoursePolicies.pdf).

### Assignments:
* Reading: <br>
The most important part of homework is reading. Many students are not used to this, but to thoroughly understand the materials, this is necessary. Before each class, you will be expected to read the section in the text for that class. After that class, you should study the materials we did in class critically, and read the text again

* Daily homework: <br>
The Math 106L Syllabus gives a complete schedule of the course along with daily homework assignments. You are expected to do the homework before each class so that you can understand the new material. This homework will not be collected nor graded, but it is unlikely that you will succeed on exams without practice.

* Problem sets:  <br>
These one-problem (often multi-part) assignments are designed to help you think more deeply about material. As a work of warning, the assignments do not fully cover the scope of the class, and you should not use them as a substitue for daily homework assignments. Assignments are due in class by the start of class on the day indicated at the top of the problem set. These problems are available under the schedule section.

You are encouraged to collaborate with others in the course and use the resources of the help room. But your written solutions must be your own, reflecting your own personal understanding. Late assignments will not be accepted.

* Lab reports: <br>
You will either have an individual quiz or be required to hand in a group report on your work in the following week's lab. 

### Midterms and Final Exam:
There will be four in-class midterms and one final in the exam period in this course.  These exams are scheduled on the following dates:

*  Test 1: Thursday <br>
*  Test 2: Thursday <br>
*  Test 3: Thursday <br>
*  Test 4: Thursday <br>
*  Final:  <br>

Calculators are not allowed in all quizzes, midterms and exams. However, in the final exam, you are allowed to bring one standard-size sheet (front and back) with whatever formulas or notes you would like. 

### Absences:
There will be no make-up exams nor rescheduled exams, except excused by your dean in the following cases:

* serious illness only if documentation is provided with a written excuse from your dean. <br>
* serious illness or death in the family only if documentation is provided with a written excuse from your dean. <br>
* athletic commitments or religious obligations only if documentation is provided with a written excuse from your dean and prior notice is given. In such cases, rescheduled exams must be taken before the rest of the class.  

### Duke Community Standard: 
Students are expected to adhere to the [Duke Community Standard](http://integrity.duke.edu/new.html) . If a student is found responsible for academic dishonesty on a graded assignment, I reserve the right to assign a grade of zero to the assignment in question and to further reduce the final grade for the course by one or more letter grades possibly to a failing grade.
